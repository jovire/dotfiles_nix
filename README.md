### Purpose
Exploring Nix and Nix package management via home-manager on a laptop running OpenSuse Tumbleweed.

The idea is to hopefully, at some point, get comfortable enough with Nix to migrate to a full NixOS setup and drop Windows all together on my desktop machine.


The idea of a fully reproducible machine via configuration files is very appealing to me but the learning curve of Nix and certain aspects of linux is steep.  
In other words, this is going to take me a considerable amount of time.

### TODO (in no particular order):
1. Fully configure Neovim (LSP, Telescope etc.)
2. Figure out how to link configuration files so that `home-manager switch` does not need to be called for every change.
3. Add/configure more CLI tools (ripgrep, fd, etc.)
4. Determine how development tools are setup (Rust, Ocaml, etc.) for project creation.
